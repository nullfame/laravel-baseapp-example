# ExampleApp

An example/reference Laravel application 
using [WeinbergIT/BaseAppLaravelPacakge](https://github.com/WeinbergIT/BaseAppLaravelPackage) (BaseApp 3.0),
a private package for Northwestern University.



## Local BaseApp

composer.json and composer.lock assume BaseApp is installed in ../BaseAppLaravelPackage/.  This allows you to develop in that directory and update this app without too much hassle.

Some helper scripts in this template branch would, ahem, help.
